This project builds on Kevin Murphy's PMTK Matlab library. It is essenntial that
this library be both installed and currently within the working path.

The primary Matlab scripts are:
  - cartSim
  - svmSim

These scripts, respectively, execute the Random Forest and SVMs implementations 
of the stock market predictors. Each script will generate a series of figures 
summarizing the results for the various experimental setups.

Also, ensure that the folder ../datasets is in the working path, so that the 
datasets are visible to the scripts. Or copy .DAT files to this ./source folder.
